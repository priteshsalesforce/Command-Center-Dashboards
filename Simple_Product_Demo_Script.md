## üè† **Opening - What This Is (0:00 - 0:30)**

*[Scene: Landing page]*

**"This is the Vision Command Center - a unified dashboard that brings together business data from across the company. It's designed to give different roles in the company the information they need to make decisions and take action."**

**"Today I'll show you how it works specifically for a Samsung Service VP persona. This demonstrates how the Command Center adapts to different roles and provides relevant insights for service operations."**

*[Navigate to Samsung Service VP Dashboard]*

**"Here's the Service VP view. Notice how the interface is tailored for service operations - focusing on customer satisfaction, support metrics, and operational efficiency."**

## üìä **Glance Tab - Overview (0:30 - 2:30)**

*[Scene: Service VP Dashboard, Glance tab]*

### **Predictive Intelligence Center (0:30 - 1:00)**
**"First, let's look at the Predictive Intelligence Center. This section shows AI-powered predictions and early warning signals."**

*[Point to predictive metrics]*

**"Here we can see predictive insights like 'Service Recovery Time' showing 8.5 hours with a prediction of +45% increase in the next week. The AI is analyzing patterns to forecast potential issues before they become critical."**

**"Customer Satisfaction Trend shows 1.8 out of 5 with a predicted -25% decline in the next quarter. This gives the Service VP advance warning to take preventive action."**

### **Activity Feed (1:00 - 1:30)**
*[Scroll to Activity Feed section]*

**"Below that is the Activity Feed - a real-time stream of important events and updates relevant to service operations."**

*[Point to activity items]*

**"You can see recent activities like 'RF-9000X Support Cases increased 89%', 'Customer escalation from Premium account', and 'New knowledge base article published'. This keeps the Service VP informed of what's happening across service operations."**

### **Activity Feed Details - Customer Satisfaction Crisis (1:30 - 2:30)**
*[Click on Customer Satisfaction Crisis activity]*

**"Let's look at this Customer Satisfaction Crisis in detail. When you click on an activity, you get the full context."**

*[Show expanded details]*

**"This shows that customer satisfaction dropped from 4.2 to 2.1 in the last 24 hours, primarily due to RF-9000X product issues. It provides the timeline, affected customer segments, and shows that 15,000 customers are impacted."**

**"The system automatically correlates this with support case volume increases, social media sentiment drops, and provides recommended immediate actions like 'Activate crisis response team' and 'Implement proactive customer communication'."**

## üîç **Monitor Tab - Operational Intelligence (2:30 - 5:00)**

*[Scene: Switch to Monitor tab]*

### **Autonomous Operations Center (2:30 - 3:00)**
**"Now let's look at the Monitor tab, which contains the Autonomous Operations Center. This is where the AI continuously monitors service operations and identifies issues that need attention."**

*[Point to autonomous operations section]*

**"You can see alerts organized by priority - critical, high, medium, and low. The system automatically categorizes and prioritizes issues based on business impact and urgency."**

### **Dashboard Overview (3:00 - 4:00)**
*[Navigate to main dashboard area]*

**"The main dashboard area has several key components. Let me walk through each one:"**

#### **Executive Performance Metrics & AI Insights (3:00 - 3:15)**
*[Point to executive metrics]*

**"At the top, we have Executive Performance Metrics showing key KPIs like Customer Satisfaction at 1.8/5, Average Response Time at 8.5 hours, and First Call Resolution at 67%. Each metric includes AI insights that explain trends and predict future performance."**

#### **Cross-Cloud Intelligence (3:15 - 3:30)**
*[Point to cross-cloud section]*

**"The Cross-Cloud Intelligence section shows correlations between different systems - how service issues relate to sales impact, marketing campaigns, and product defects. For example, it's connecting the RF-9000X product issues to increased support volume and decreased customer satisfaction."**

#### **Detailed Analysis - Service Case Volume & Resolution (3:30 - 4:00)**
*[Click on Service Case Volume graph]*

**"Here's the Detailed Analysis section. Let's look at the Service Case Volume & Resolution graph. This shows case volume trending upward with resolution times increasing."**

*[Point to What-If Analysis button]*

**"There's a 'What-If Analysis' feature that lets you model different scenarios. For example, 'What if we add 20 more support agents?' or 'What if we implement automated responses for common issues?'"**

*[Click Ask Agentforce button]*

**"And there's an 'Ask Agentforce' button where you can ask natural language questions about the data, like 'Why are resolution times increasing?' or 'What's causing the spike in RF-9000X cases?'"**

### **Operational Views (4:00 - 5:00)**
*[Navigate through different operational sections]*

#### **Watchlist (4:00 - 4:15)**
**"The Watchlist shows critical accounts and issues that need constant monitoring. These are typically high-value customers or escalated cases that require executive attention."**

#### **Intraday (4:15 - 4:30)**
**"Intraday shows real-time operational metrics - current queue lengths, agent availability, response times, and service level performance throughout the day."**

#### **In-Progress Work (4:30 - 4:45)**
**"In-Progress Work displays all active cases, their status, assigned agents, and expected resolution times. This gives the Service VP visibility into current workload and resource allocation."**

#### **Backlogs (4:45 - 5:00)**
**"Finally, Backlogs shows overdue cases, pending escalations, and work that's behind schedule. This helps identify capacity issues and areas needing immediate attention."**

### **Concept of Strategy Boards (5:00 - 5:30)**

*[Point to strategy board grid]*

**"Strategy Boards connect goals, metrics, actions, and outcomes in one place. Each board represents a major strategic initiative with real-time progress tracking, risk assessment, and AI-powered recommendations."**

- **"Customer Satisfaction: Currently 2.1/5 with a target of 4.2/5 - marked as Critical"**
- **"Issue Resolution Rate: 65% with a target of 95% - Behind schedule"**

## üë• **Different Views for Different Roles (6:30 - 7:00)**

**"The Command Center adapts to different roles in the company. We've been looking at the Service VP view, but here's how the same crisis looks from a CXO perspective."**

*[Show CXO dashboard briefly]*

**"The CXO sees the same RF-9000X crisis, but with a focus on overall business impact - revenue at risk, brand reputation, and cross-functional coordination. The data is the same, but the presentation and priorities are tailored to executive decision-making."**

*[Return to Service VP view]*

**"Each role gets the information that's most relevant to their responsibilities and decision-making needs, while maintaining visibility into the broader business context."**

## ü§ñ **AI Assistant Integration (7:00 - 7:30)**

**"Throughout the system, there's an AI assistant called Agentforce that provides contextual intelligence and guidance."**

*[Demonstrate a simple chat interaction]*

**"You can ask it questions in natural language like 'What's causing the increase in RF-9000X cases?' or 'What should be our priority action for improving customer satisfaction?' It provides answers based on the business data, current context, and strategic objectives."**

**"The AI understands the Service VP's role and provides recommendations specific to service operations - whether that's resource allocation, process improvements, or crisis response strategies."**

## üì± **Summary - What You Get (7:30 - 8:00)**
