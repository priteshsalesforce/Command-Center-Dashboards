## üé§ **Delivery Guidelines**

### **Tone:**
- **Matter-of-fact and informative** - explaining, not selling
- **Clear and direct** - focus on what it does
- **Professional but conversational** - like explaining to a colleague
- **No hyperbole** - just describe the features

### **Pacing:**
- **Steady and measured** - give people time to see what you're showing
- **Pause at transitions** - let them absorb each section
- **Match voice to visuals** - describe what's on screen
- **Don't rush** - better to be thorough than fast

### **Focus:**
- **Functionality over benefits** - show what it does, not why it's amazing
