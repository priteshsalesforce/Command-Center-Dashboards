The Enterprise Command Center: Vision
and Design
The Command Center is designed as a centralized, unified, and intelligent system to provide
unprecedented visibility and control over how work gets done across an enterprise, functioning
as the "nervous system" of a modern organization. It aims to accelerate decision-making and
compress the time between sensing an issue and taking optimal action.
Here's a breakdown of its design:
1. Core Deliverable and Overall Vision:
• The Command Center is a core deliverable under the broader Agentic Enterprise vision.
• It's more than just a dashboard; it's envisioned as a "living, breathing interface to the enterprise
itself".
• Its high-level goal is to enable real-time decision-making, unified insights, and operational
agility for various personas and users.
• It also serves as a marketing "wall board"—a high-level, visual representation of the Agentic
Enterprise for key stakeholders like the CEO and LOB leaders.
2. Key Design Principles & Pillars:
• Role-based Command Center: Tailored for executive visibility and other specific roles.
• Ontology-driven framework: A flexible framework for knowledge, goals, and processes that
defines real-world business relationships and drives AI goals and feedback loops.
• Slack as the engagement layer: Prioritizes Slack for most end-user interaction, functioning as
a conversational canvas for people and agents to collaborate, and a "front door" to the Agentic
Enterprise, especially for mobile use. However, it's not Slack-only; a Lightning equivalent UX is
planned.
• Real-time feedback and agent learning loops: Continuously incorporates feedback to improve
operations and agent performance.
• Internal and external agent orchestration: Designed to coordinate both human and AI agents
across various systems.
• Active Communication, Live, Transparent, Actionability, Collaboration, Automation, and
Agentic are also guiding principles.
3. Layered Architecture for User Behavior: The Command Center's design is informed by
interconnected layers that support distinct types of human behavior as people and agents work
across the enterprise:
• Ontology Layer: The foundational "graph" defining organizational units, processes, resources,
goals, KPIs, assets, personnel, and knowledge. It's designed to be AI-read/write friendly, directly
influencing AI goals and feedback loops.
• Exploratory Layer: Provides UIs for understanding the performance of humans and agents and
deriving operational and strategic insights. This includes the Unified Command Center, CSI
(Customer Signals Intelligence), and Agentforce Interaction Explorer.
• Operational Layer: Encompasses products and tools where shared work between humans and
AI gets done. This involves tracking and managing live conversations, work items, and tasks

with various visualizations like Kanban boards, wall dashboards, and alerts. Examples include
OmniSupervisor for real-time operations.
• Learning Layer: Focuses on explicit and implicit feedback, with AI-powered recommendations
for improvement across operational, experience, and ontological layers. It captures human input
and aggregates it into AI recommendations to enhance agent performance and process design.
• Refinement Layer: Offers AI-assisted experiences to improve at both strategic (ontological)
and operational levels, acting like a strategic consultant for designing dashboards, metrics, and
goals, or an implementation consultant for authoring processes, agent instructions, and building
integrations.
4. Unified Command Center Experience (Home Page): The Command Center is designed to be
a Unified Command Center, a primary user interface to see, understand, and take action across
the Agentic Enterprise. It flexes to many views for different users and use cases, driven by
ontology to filter, focus, and adjust the UX. The "Home" view is crucial and aims to provide:
• Conversational Search: Fully agentic, across all parts of the enterprise.
• Voice-based and written conversational UX: With Agentforce acting as an assistant.
• Watch list of health "Flags/Alerts": Proactively pushed across the entire enterprise (sales,
service, marketing, HR, ops) and broader industry based on user priorities.
• Spaces/Boards/Focus: Customized by users to monitor specific goals and dimensions of the
business (e.g., a digital campaign's impact on service cases). These allow agents to reason
across hierarchical goals connected through the ontology.
• Stories/Casts: Voice readouts summarizing status or issues within a "Space," serving as a
launch point into conversations with assistive AI.
• Cards: Live on a focused Board, displaying KPIs and alerts tied to a board's tags, acting as
launch points into Agentforce Studio and OmniSupervisor for agent, process, and operational
performance tuning.
5. Role-Based Customization: The design accounts for different personas, providing tailored
views:
• Executive (CEO/CXO): Needs a strategic, top-line view focusing on overall business health,
financial, customer, and operational metrics. This includes predictive analytics, scenario
planning, and executive alerts. The CEO view often starts on Slack Mobile.
• Line of Business VP/Director: Requires performance monitoring and decision support, with
deeper dives into departmental performance, operational efficiency, and resource allocation
within their domain. This includes operational dashboards and tools for resource allocation
planning.
• Supervisor/Specialist/Doer Persona: Needs granular, task-level, and operational insights for
immediate action, problem-solving, and adherence to procedures. This view features task
queues, SLA monitors, knowledge bases, and AI-driven next-best actions. The team view often
starts on Slack Desktop.
6. Integration with Existing Tools and Data: The Command Center is not a replacement for
existing operational tools like CSI or OmniSupervisor, but rather connects to and elevates these
systems.
• Customer Signals Intelligence (CSI): Integrated for analytical, strategic, and action-oriented
overviews of how different parts of the business influence each other. It's powered by C360

Suite, CSI, Data Cloud, and Agentforce, providing KPI summaries, predictive capabilities with
"What-If" analysis, and operational actionability.
• OmniSupervisor: Used for real-time operations management, including queue-based,
worker-based, and stage-based views for "in the moment" low-latency call center work and
general multi-stage work like order processing.
• Agentforce Studio: Provides tools for agent performance and execution, including Interaction
Explorer, Agent Builders, and Agentforce Analytics, allowing teams to fix issues by restructuring
process maps or rebuilding agent flows.
• Common Layer (Semantic Data Model, Goals, Ontology): This forms the underlying
foundation, integrating data sources and enabling agents to understand and reason across
customer tooling, technologies, processes, and business logic. The Command Center supports
two presentation layers: Slack and Lightning, and two views: Kanban and List, being agnostic
about the object type.
In essence, the Command Center is designed to be a comprehensive, dynamic, and intelligent
hub that seamlessly integrates data, AI, and human interaction across all levels of an
organization, from strategic oversight to tactical execution.
