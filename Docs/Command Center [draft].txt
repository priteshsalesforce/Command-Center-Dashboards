Command Center [draft]
Introduction
Command Center is envisioned as a unified control layer that brings together enterprise data, AI agents, and human decision-making into a single, cohesive environment. Its purpose is to give every level of the organization — from executives to frontline employees — the ability to see, understand, and act on cross-functional signals in real time. 
Problem Statement
Enterprises are overwhelmed by complexity. Data is fragmented across different systems and AI tools exist in isolation, solving narrow problems with limited context and governance. Users struggle with lagging dashboards that explain what has already gone wrong, and lack guidance on what to do next. With agentic AI introduction, the challenges deepen, with limited visibility in agent actions, and struggle to monitor bias, drift, and compliance in increasingly autonomous systems. 
Without a unified command center, enterprises risk siloed insights, uncoordinated actions, and loss of trust in AI systems.
Goals
The Command Center aims to:
1. Unify cross-cloud data and ontology: Providing a single source of truth and cross-cloud view that maps entities, relationships, and events across Sales, Marketing, Revenue, Service, Field, and beyond. Use C360 SDM as a starting point. 
2. Empower every persona: Use Customer Signals Intelligence, Tableau Next and Einstein Studio along with Algo pool to deliver analytics/predictive insights and actionability (using Slack-first approach) for personas across the organization. 
3. Shift from reactive to proactive management: Leverage Einstein Studio and Algo pool to detect anomalies early, run “what-if” simulations and scenario planning, and test playbooks so organizations can prevent crises. Use constrained optimization algorithms in Einstein Studio to create optimal scenarios, based on real business constraints. 
4. Orchestrate humans and agents: Enable cloud, Tableau Next, and CSI agents to propose and simulate actions, while keeping humans in control through transparent approvals, explainability, and governance.
5. Embed governance and trust: Ensure every metric, and action is auditable, explainable, and compliant.

	Scope
Command Center will include:
1. Cross-Cloud Data Integration
   1. Unified data model and ontology linking entities and events across Sales, Marketing, Revenue, Service, Field, and other clouds.
   2. Support for both structured and unstructured data (e.g., transactions, service notes, documents, social media etc)
   3. Real time updates for actions taken by agents and humans
   4. Real time signals extraction from every touch point of user interaction
2. Persona-Aware Slack-first Experiences
   1. Cater to multiple personas and hierarchy, with insights and actions
3. Cross Cloud Customer Signals Intelligence
   1. Unified cross cloud dashboards with data from all the clouds/departments
   2. Anomaly detection across business processes.
   3. “What-if” simulation capabilities for strategic and operational decisions.
   4. Experimentation engine for testing interventions and comparing outcomes.
   5. Scenario optimization based on business constraints
4. Simplified action panels
   1. Managing tasks and work items using simplified views such as Kanban, timeline/gantt chart, watchlists, calendar etc. 
   2. Custom actions based on the clouds and industry context
5. Agent Orchestration & Control
   1. Ability for agents to generate proposals, simulate outcomes, and execute approved actions.
   2. Human-in-the-loop workflows to ensure oversight and accountability.
   3. Real time Agent performance monitoring and control
6. Industry-specific customizations
   1. While initial focus is horizontal clouds, expand to Industries clouds as an immediate followup
7. Governance & Trust Layer
   1. End-to-end lineage, audit trails, and explainability for data, models, and agentic actions
   2. Bias/drift monitoring and alerts for ML models.
   3. Collecting user feedback, and using it for model/agent improvement
   4. Role-based access controls and approval hierarchies.
Command Center will exclude:
1. System replacements: the Command Center complements the capabilities in Salesforce clouds.
2. Full automation without human oversight: while agents will propose and sometimes act, final accountability remains with human decision-makers.

Strategic Initiatives Review:
   1. Review the status of newly launched AI-enabled-connected AC (promising better temp control, connected-device features, and cost savings) targeted to both B2C and B2B segments. 
   2. Each department presents the contribution to the launch through the command center, and the challenges faced
   1. Marketing 
   2. Sales
   3. Service 
   4. Field Service
        
        Topics discussed include: 
Sales:
   * How is revenue tracking? 
   * Are B2B customers converting at expected cycle times?
   * What is the growth of the B2C segment vs B2B? 
   * Which region/segment is promising for the next phase of growth?
Marketing:
   * Campaign resonance with “AI-enabled” positioning. (feedback from users)
   * Which channels (digital, dealer network, trade shows) are most effective?
Service & Support:
   * Spike in calls/issues? AI features confusing users?
   * Average response/resolution times.
   * Customer satisfaction with product and service. 
Field Services:
   * Work order spikes and component failures. 
   * Warranty/spares readiness.


Highlights: 
   1. B2C sales is good. 
   1. Expand to new regions. Use simulation to identify potential new regions. 
   1. Marketing cloud campaigns in the new regions
   2. But the Service and Field Service teams might face capacity issues with scaling
   1. Plus due to part failures the expansion will increase the cost to serve the customers. 
   3. Action: 
   1. Need approval marketing budgets to campaigns can be run in APAC region for $3M (Case + Approval)
   2. Expected new revenue from the campaign ($35M)
   2. B2B deals are stalled, and need a new discounting approach. 
   1. Sales cloud with ABM
   1. Monitor pipeline velocity and stage-duration metrics.
   2. Analyse the feedback from lost deals
   3. Escalation to the account manager to connect the customer
   2. Revenue Cloud
   1. Use optimization/simulation to suggest new discounts for exec approvals. 
   1. Show the segments details
   2. Track quote turnaround time and contract closure rate.
   3. Service cases are spiking and with expectation to reduce cost and expand the use of Agentforce. 
   * Deploy AI feature knowledge articles and in-app guidance
   * Improve case categorization to ensure correct routing (AI-feature vs. hardware issue).
   * Automate case resolution with Agentforce AI feature questions.
   * Simulate the increase in capacity needed with expansion
   4. Field Service cases are rising due to failure in sensors in high humidity environments. 
   1. Simulate the increase in capacity needed with expansion
   2. Enable remote diagnostics before dispatch
   1. Predict/Estimate the parts to be ordered and the cost/discount
   3. Monitor cost per visit and escalations


Actions are captured and tracked, so that they can be reviewed in the next QBR, along with the actions and impact. 
Actions are identified and added to the action tracker with owners as the department heads (VPs) with the following details. The actions are then split into sub-actions based on the hierarchy, with level specific metrics as goals. 
Dependency between actions and KPIs
        Department | Action | Cross-cloud KPIs | Owner
Sub-Action | Owner
KPI1: current -> goal
KPI2: current -> goal


Progression needed: Exec → VP → Manager → Frontline
